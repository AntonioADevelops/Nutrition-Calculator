  <h1>About the Ingredients Data</h1>
  <p>The data used in this web app is from the CORGIS Dataset Project and can be found <a href="https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/json/ingredients/">here.</a> The data contains the nutritional values of 1 FDA recommended serving size of various recorded food ingredients from years 2017 to 2018. And while the data may seem outdated, it is the latest public dataset of nutritional information on food ingredients given by the USDA’s food composition database which is where the CORGIS data is pulled from.</p>
  <p>The dataset gives us the full composition of the food item, relaying the amount of protein, carbs, and kinds of fats as well as the vitamins and major minerals in a single serving. Protein, carbs, and fats are recorded in grams (g) and vitamins and minerals are recorded in milligrams (mg) with certain chemical components, like alpha and beta carotene, being measured in micrograms (mcg).</p>
  <p>The food is divided into categories with its varieties listed under. Take sourdough bread for example. Listed under the bread category, a serving of sourdough bread contains 10.75 g of protein, 51.88 g of carbohydrates, and a total lipid (total of all types of fats) count of 2.42g. It also contains very small amounts of Vitamins B6 (0.107 mcg), E (0.21 mcg), and K (0.7 mcg).</p>
  <p>Utilizing this data can be very advantageous to your health. Knowing what you put in your body can help with meal preparation especially those who maintain strict macro restrictions such as athletes or avid gym goers. Input the ingredients as well as the amount used in terms of serving size. As the dataset does not give the amount in a serving, it’s up to the user to find it. For example if a serving size is 100g and you use 200g of said ingredients, input 2 servings in the field.</p>
